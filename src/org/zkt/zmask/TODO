Before 0.1 release:
* Select all / none does not work
* Zoom in View menu does not work
  - In
  - Out
  - 1:1
  - Fit to window
* Warn on close changed images

Improvments
* Webstart
  - Test (and fix)
* Statusbar
  - Boxes should be able to grow, but have a fixed min
    that fits most coords, and only grow in fixed increments at need
  - Icon for each box
  - Resize box(es) (e.g. zoom)
  - Selection description
  - Image info (size)
  - Number of undo/redo items?
  - Drawing a bit too slow; render boxes more statically + drawImage?
* What to do with State?
  - Singleton?
  - Move methods out?
    - Tool class? Better separation between image and tools? Selection object
      to be put in imagechange? Tool stroke in specific tool class?
    - More methods in the respective class?
    - A more clean helper?
* Shortcut keys - does not work
* Rename image class? to avoid confustion with image interface..
* Preview in open dialog
* Hand tool resets when outside the window
* Save dialog should warn if jpeg|png and xor in path
* Cut/Copy/Paste

* About dialog is crap
  - No idea how that layout works, but it is very static. replace.
  - License box not wide enough
* Double-click with select to do "wand" selection

Masks
* CP [detect?]
* B3
* Nijiiro

Testing

Features
* Solve dialogue (avoid printing unneccessary steps)

  - only handle the selected area
* Tree-based undo
* Print path, add optimize to path
* Checkpointing undo history ("fast-forward undo / redo")
* Execute path, possibility to execute selection (and settings?)
* Printing
  - http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/2d/printing/index.html
* Other solution of undo menu
  - http://java.dzone.com/news/drop-down-buttons-swing-new-al
